# Computational-Physics
This repository contains problems and solutions for Computational Physics by Mark Newman as solved by me.

Personally I'm uploading this for educational purposes. In particular, High-School teachers wanting to give a computational component to their math of physics courses.

## Categorization of Labs folder
A categorization is given below of the problems found under the `Labs/` directory with my opinion on their difficulty. 

Note for teachers

- Easy Physics
    - Lab 1
    - Lab 2 (Relativity)
- Advanced Physics
    - Lab 4 (Sunspots) - Concept is easy enough but involves multiple python concepts
        - Loops, Plotting, if-else, functions.
    - Lab 8 (Involves some algebra, then using the binary search method)
- Easy Math
    - Lab 3 (trigonometry)
    - Lab 7 (easy numerical integration with the trapezoidal rule)
- Advanced Math
    - Lab 5 - easy concept of quadratic equation but focuses more on numerical stability
    - Lab 6 - Derivatives but focuses more on numerical accuracy
    - Lab 9 - Roots of a polynomial using the Newtonâ€™s method
